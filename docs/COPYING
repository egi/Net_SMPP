Thats fine.. I might suggest you add the section reference to the same
comment only for encouraging the reader to look at the spec for more
detail.. but either way what you have there is OK by me.=20

Text copies are fine.. I was more worried about documentation that might
replicate entire pages and sections etc.. this is where we stand strict
because it encourages variant specifications and as you would
understand, thats dangerous.
